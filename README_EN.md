# üèîÔ∏è Ascend

**Your Personal Dashboard for Life's Climb.**

Tired of rigid, corporate productivity tools that force you to work *their* way? Ascend takes a different path. It's not just another task manager; it's your personal, customizable dashboard for orchestrating your life.

The philosophy behind Ascend is simple: your tools should adapt to you, not the other way around. For anyone striving to bring order to chaos, the journey feels like a mountain ascent. Ascend is designed to be your personal base camp, your multi-tool, and your trusted compass on that journey.

## ‚ú® The Ascend Philosophy

*   **More Than a To-Do List.** We go beyond a simple checklist. Ascend aims to be your personal "multi-tool," integrating the utilities you actually need‚Äîfrom a Pomodoro timer and a music player to handy coding tools.

*   **Your Personal Hub.** Forget switching between a dozen apps. Ascend is built to be a central hub for life's different contexts: managing your finances, reading your books, tracking personal projects, and much more.

*   **True Modularity.** This is the core principle. Don't need a finance tracker? Turn it off. Want to add your city's subway map to your dashboard? In the future, you can. Ascend is being built as an ecosystem where **you choose** the modules you need, creating the perfect workspace for yourself.

## üöÄ Current Features

*   **A robust API core** built with FastAPI and SQLModel.
*   **Flexible authentication system** (Email/password + OAuth2).
*   **Secure storage** for secrets and API keys.
*   **Task Management Module** with full CRUD functionality.
*   **Comprehensive test coverage** for all implemented features.

## üó∫Ô∏è Vision & Roadmap: The Modules of Your Dashboard

The future of Ascend is a constantly growing collection of modules that you can enable as you see fit.

*   [ ] **üí° Idea Box:** A single place for your ideas, thoughts, and notes.
*   [ ] **üí∞ Wallet:** A financial assistant to track income, expenses, and savings.
*   [ ] **üíª Code Time:** Integration with GitHub/GitLab (including self-hosted instances) to track your coding activity.
*   [ ] **üìö Library:** Your personal digital library for storing and reading books (PDF, ePub).
*   [ ] **üéµ Music:** A module for playing music, potentially with streaming service integrations.
*   [ ] **üóìÔ∏è Calendar:** A powerful, Exchange-style calendar for planning your events and appointments.
*   [ ] **üçÖ Pomodoro & Focus Tools:** Built-in timers and utilities for deep work sessions.
*   [ ] **‚öôÔ∏è Utilities:** Useful small tools, like a currency converter, that should always be at your fingertips.

...and much more. **The ultimate goal is to give the user complete control over their personal toolkit.**

    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend/` directory. You can copy `.env.example` (if it exists) or create it from scratch.

    **.env**
    ```env
    DB_PATH="sqlite:///./database.db"
    DEBUG=True

    # Generate with: from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())
    ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-strong-encryption-key"

    # Generate with: import secrets; secrets.token_hex(32)
    SECRET_KEY="your-32-byte-secret-key-for-jwt"
    
    JWT_ALGORITHM="HS256"
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60
    TIMEZONE="UTC"
    ```

### 3. Database & Launch

1.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

2.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn src.main:app --reload
    ```
    The API and documentation will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
